This application implements the deletion comment and undeletion feature. This app follows the MERN architecture. An important point to note is that this app uses a non relational database. While conventionally SQL dbs would be preferred for storing such data, I strongly believe that the freedom provided by no SQL databases outweighs the benefits of SQL databases. I would love to connect and discuss this in detail!

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!
